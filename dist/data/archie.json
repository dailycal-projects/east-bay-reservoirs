This command will, similar to configuring archie/google doc support, ask for the spreadsheet’s doc ID. Then run `gulp spreadsheet`. This will pull the data from your spreadsheet into `src/data/data.json`. If running `gulp spreadsheet` throws an error along the lines of, “ Task 'spreadsheet' is not in your gulpfile,” then head on over to your project’s `gulpfile.js` and add `spreadsheet` to the array that `gulp` requires. Then run `gulp spreadsheet`. With this, `src/data/data.json` should be populated. \n\nOnce again, if you run into issues with the generator, the <a href=\"https://github.com/dailycal-projects/generator-dailycal-projects\">README</a> of the generator and the <a href=\"https://generator-politico-interactives.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html\">readthedocs</a> of the generator from which this one is forked are useful."}]}
